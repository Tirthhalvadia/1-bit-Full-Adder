# 1-bit-Full-Adder

## Project Description
This project involves the design, simulation, and analysis of a 1-bit static CMOS full adder circuit using Cadence Virtuoso. The primary goals are to assess variability and performance improvements through various simulations.

## Key Features

Cadence Virtuoso Design: Utilized Cadence Virtuoso for the schematic capture, layout, and simulation of the 1-bit full adder circuit.

Comprehensive Simulations: Conducted corner and Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate variability and random mismatch effects.

Performance Analysis: Demonstrated substantial performance improvements compared to pre-layout values through thorough simulation and analysis.

## Introduction
This project focuses on designing a 1-bit full adder with propagation delays (TpLH and TpHL) as close as possible. The primary aim is to investigate the design intricacies of this full adder and evaluate its performance under various conditions, including corner simulations, Monte Carlo analysis for local mismatch, and post-layout simulations. Furthermore, the report includes circuit design, transistor sizing, functional and post-layout simulations, and analyze worst-case delay and power consumption under different scenarios.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
To work on this project, you will need:

•  Cadence Virtuoso

•  Basic understanding of CMOS technology and digital circuit design

## Design Overview
The design involves creating a schematic for a 1-bit full adder using static CMOS technology. The layout is then created and validated using Cadence Virtuoso's DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) tools.
